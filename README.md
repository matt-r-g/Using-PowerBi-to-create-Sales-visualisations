# 📊 Power BI Visualisations: PBISales Dataset Report 🖥️

Welcome to the repository! In this project, I created insightful visualisations in **Power BI** using the **PBISales dataset**. The visualisation report explores key metrics related to sales performance, providing a clear and interactive view of the data. This project was developed on a **virtual machine** environment to ensure flexibility and consistency in the setup.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a series of **dynamic and interactive visualisations** to explore the **PBISales dataset**. The goal of the analysis is to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance across different dimensions like regions, products and time.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: A business analytics tool for creating interactive reports and dashboards.
- **PBISales Dataset**: A dataset containing information about sales transactions, customers, and products.
- **Virtual Machine**: The development environment used to ensure a consistent and isolated working space.


## 📈 Visualisations Included

The Power BI report features several visualisations designed to help analyse and interpret sales data, including:

- **Sales Trends**: Line charts showing sales over time.

## 🖥️ Development Environment

The project was developed using a **virtual machine (VM)** environment to ensure the following:

- **Consistency**: Using a VM allowed for replicating the exact software setup across different devices.
- **Isolation**: The VM provided an isolated environment for working with Power BI and the dataset, ensuring that the project does not interfere with other projects or applications.
- **Flexibility**: A VM can be easily backed up and restored, providing security for the project's data and configuration.


## 💡 Key Takeaways

Using Power BI allowed me to create a rich, interactive experience for exploring the PBISales dataset.
The virtual machine setup was useful for maintaining a stable and replicable environment, ensuring consistency throughout the project.
The visualisations provide valuable insights into sales trends, regional performance and product sales.
